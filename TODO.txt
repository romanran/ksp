- set states in root part tag and check status from there
 add sats cloud, next launched sat takes orbital period of previous sats and aims for the same orbital period
 write getNearestPart library for staging purposes 
 -if energy low, start fuel cell
- rotate craft with pid for maximum sun exposure
 check for gimbals, if there are non in current stage,  enable RCS while in vacuum, or vernier engines while in atmosphere
- make program creator

 save created programs in json
 check if comm range is within max ranges of antennas on board
 check different gravity turns slopes by comparing dV and resources used
 - if throttle is 0, thrust with RCS
 check all for the parts
 - check the programming for the second staging wait under no thrust
 - move journal to a separate volume
