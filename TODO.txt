- set states in root part tag and check status from there
 - add sats cloud, next launched sat takes orbital period of previous sats and aims for the same orbital period 
 -if energy low, start fuel cell
- rotate craft with pid for maximum sun exposure
 check for gimbals, if there are non in current stage,  enable RCS while in vacuum, or vernier engines while in atmosphere
- make program creator
- move all of the ifs to function and load them on program checklist. for example, in altitude ifs, call a function "deployantennas", so the function can be called even from ground.
 - save created programs in json
 check if comm range is within max ranges of antennas on board
 - check different gravity turns slopes by comparing dV and resources used
 - if throttle is 0, thrust with RCS
 check all for the parts
 - check the programming for the second staging wait under no thrust
 - move journal to a separate volume
 
 - move Aurora phase modules loading to a program selector
 - make a list of dependencies for each module, make a function to check if those dependencies are met
 - make a menu for testing all modules
 
 Create stages object, calculate needed dV and check if current stage and the next ones have necessary dV for the maneuver
 Write coasting module for specific target (whole menu for phases)
 Add first commsat apoapsis reach time to programm json
 Thrusting phase deceleration based on specific distance left
 Communication interface, send a task to a probe
